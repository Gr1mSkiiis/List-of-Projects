# 🧠 Jordy's Networking Lab

Welcome to my home lab repository, where I document, build, and experiment with real-world networking projects. This repo serves as a portfolio of hands-on configurations, designs, and tools related to:

- VLAN segmentation & Layer 3 routing  
- pfSense firewall policies & DMZ setup  
- Cisco switch and router configuration  
- Wireless access point deployment  
- Network monitoring (ICINGA, SolarWinds)  
- DNS sinkholing with Pi-hole  
- Remote access, NAT, and port forwarding  
- Network security labs & honeypots

## 📁 Projects Breakdown

Each project folder includes:

- A **README** with project goals and architecture  
- **Configuration files** (e.g., Cisco CLI, pfSense exports)  
- **Network diagrams** (physical and logical)  
- Test results, screenshots, or logs when applicable
